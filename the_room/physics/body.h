/**
* a rigid body is the basic simulation object in the physics
* core.
*
* it has position and orientation data, along with first
* derivatives. it can be integrated forward through time, and
* have forces, torques and impulses (linear or angular) applied
* to it. the rigid body manages its state and allows access
* through a set of methods.
*
* a ridid body contains 64 words (the size of which is given
* by the precision: sizeof(real)). it contains no virtual
* functions, so should take up exactly 64 words in memory.
