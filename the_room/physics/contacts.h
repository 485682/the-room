/**
* a contact represents two bodies in contact. resolving a
* contact removes their interpenetration, and applies sufficient
* impulse to keep them apart. colliding bodies may also rebound.
* contacts can be used to represent positional joints, by making
* the contact constraint keep the bodies in their correct
* orientation.
*
* it can be a good idea to create a contact object even when the
* contact isn't violated. because resolving one contact can violate
* another, contacts that are close to being violated should be
* sent to the resolver; that way if one resolution moves the body,
* the contact may be violated, and can be resolved. if the contact
* is not violated, it will not be resolved, so you only loose a
* small amount of execution time.
*
* the contact has no callable functions, it just holds the contact
* details. to resolve a set of contacts, use the contact resolver
* class.

/**
* the contact resolution routine. one resolver instance
* can be shared for the whole simulation, as long as you need
* roughly the same parameters each time (which is normal).
*
* resolution algorithm
*
* the resolver uses an iterative satisfaction algorithm; it loops
* through each contact and tries to resolve it. each contact is
* resolved locally, which may in turn put other contacts in a worse
* position. the algorithm then revisits other contacts and repeats
* the process up to a specified iteration limit. it can be proved
* that given enough iterations, the simulation will get to the
* correct result. as with all approaches, numerical stability can
* cause problems that make a correct resolution impossible.
*
* strengths
*
* this algorithm is very fast, much faster than other physics
* approaches. even using many more iterations than there are
* contacts, it will be faster than global approaches.
*
* many global algorithms are unstable under high friction, this
* approach is very robust indeed for high friction and low
* restitution values.
*
* the algorithm produces visually believable behaviour. tradeoffs
* have been made to err on the side of visual realism rather than
* computational expense or numerical accuracy.
*
* weaknesses
*
* the algorithm does not cope well with situations with many
* inter-related contacts: stacked boxes, for example. in this
* case the simulation may appear to jiggle slightly, which often
* dislodges a box from the stack, allowing it to collapse.
*
* another issue with the resolution mechanism is that resolving
* one contact may make another contact move sideways against
* friction, because each contact is handled independently, this
* friction is not taken into account. if one object is pushing
* against another, the pushed object may move across its support
* without friction, even though friction is set between those bodies.
*
* in general this resolver is not suitable for stacks of bodies,
* but is perfect for handling impact, explosive, and flat resting
* situations.
